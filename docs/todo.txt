some nodejs snippets:
I suppose you could install express with npm

if that is the case you could have a package.json with your app dependencies e.g. express

with that in place you can configure runtime = 'nodejs4.3' for your lambda_dev.conf

and deploy via "ramuda deploy" (edited)

your api gateway u usually have a swagger.yaml

and you deploy that using "yugen deploy" probably need  an api-key to make that work

for nodejs we do not have config scaffolding but if you are fit in nodejs you can help us with that

maybe the screencast is helpful to get the gist of gcdt but it does not cover your specific usecase

in fact express can be installed via npm: `$ npm install express --save` (edited)

why the VPN requirement? (edited)

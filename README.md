# Documentation for gcdt

author: glomex SRE Team
gcdt: https://github.com/glomex/gcdt

We needed to ease writing and improving gcdt documentation. For this we moved all documentation into this repository. No pull-request, build, merge etc. necessary. Best is to just open the file in github and document away.
